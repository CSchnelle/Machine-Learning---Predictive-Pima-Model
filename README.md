# Machine-Learning-Predictive-Pima-Model

#Predicting Diabetes Project

#Solution Statement:
"Use the Machine Learning Workflow to process and transform Pima Indian Diabetes data to create prediction model. 
This model must predict which people are likely to develop diabetes with 70% or greater accuracy."

This project follows the Understanding Machine Learning W/Python lesson plan taught by Jerry Kurata. 

This code contains documentation describing the entire Machine Learning Workflow:
Solution Statement - Preparing Data - Algorithm Selection - Training the Model - Testing the Model

This project uses data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the dataset used is Pima Indian Diabetes
